#font_sans_serif="DejaVu Sans"
#font_cursive="DejaVu Sans"

# font_serif="times"

#adjust_table_min_width=YES

#                               PENALTIES
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Penalties are used to control good and bad break points. The bigger
# the penalty for a given break point, the less likely the line is
# broken here. "inf" means that breaking is prohibited, "-inf" means
# that a line *must* be broken here. (The latter should not be used
# here, however.) Normal spaces get a penalty of 0. The exact
# definition can be found in doc/dw-line-breaking.doc.

# Penalties for hyphenation breaks; this covers automatic hyphenation,
# soft hyphens, and unconditional hyphens. Since hyphenation should
# rather be avoided, the default values are larger than 0.

# This is used for hyphenation points, when there is no hyphen or dash
# before:
#penalty_hyphen = 1

# This is used for hyphenation points, when the line before ends
# already with a hyphen or a dash. Consequent lines ending with
# hyphens or dashes should be avoided, so this value is bigger than
# "penalty_hyphen":
#penalty_hyphen_2 = 8

# The same for a break right of an em-dash, when there are no spaces
# surrounding it (as in English). The default values are the same as
# for hyphens:
#penalty_em_dash_right = 1
#penalty_em_dash_right_2 = 8

# Penalty for a break *left* of an em-dash. Since a line ending with
# an em-dash (and so breaking right of the em-dash) looks better than
# a line beginning with an em-dash (breaking left of an em-dash), the
# default value is bigger than "penalty_em_dash_right":
#penalty_em_dash_left = 8

# Notice that there is no "penalty_em_dash_left_2", since breaking
# left of an em-dash makes the line *begin*, not *end* with a dash.

# This factor is multiplied with the line height to get the
# stretchability of a non-justified line. The larger this factor (and
# thus, the stretchability), the less likely the words are hyphenated;
# so you can use this value to control hyphenation of non-justified
# text.
#stretchability_factor=1

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# UI theme
# "none" is the default FLTK appearance, which "resembles old Windows...and
# old GTK/KDE".
# "plastic" "is inspired by the Aqua user interface on Mac OS X".
# "gtk+" "is inspired by the Red Hat Bluecurve theme".
#
# If you have fltk-1.3.3 or newer, you can specify "gleam", which
# is "a sort of Clearlooks Glossy scheme".  ("fltk-config --version")
#theme=none

# theme=plastic

# UI colors
# Note that FLTK may sometimes override colors, generally for contrast and
# readability.
#
# ui_fg_color, ui_main_bg_color, ui_text_bg_color, and ui_selection_color
# map to concepts in the underlying FLTK toolkit which are described as:
# "the default foreground color...used for labels and text", "default
# background color", "the default background color for text, list, and
# valuator widgets", and "the default selection/highlight color". They
# sometimes have other uses in the more complex FLTK widgets.
#
# ui_button_highlight_color is the background used when the mouse cursor is
# over a button. By default, this is a lightened version of the main
# background color.
#
# ui_tab_active_fg_color and ui_tab_active_bg_color are used for the current
# tab. By default, they are the main foreground color and the text background
# color, respectively.
#
# ui_tab_fg_color and ui_tab_bg_color are used for the other tabs. By default,
# they are the main foreground color and the main background color,
# respectively.
#
# ui_tab_height controls the height of the tabs (default 20).
#
# Note to packagers: leaving these variables for the system to guess
# gives different results in different environments, so we played it safe
# by defining the traditional colors.  Please choose the color theme that
# better fits your distro.
