Todo List

 File dpi_service.c
 This module should be removed because its original functions
 have been removed or modified. Put these functions in dpid.c

 File dpi_service.h
 This module should be removed because its original functions
 have been removed or modified. Put these functions in dpid.c

 Add other file types, but first we need to add files associated
 with a dpi to the design.

 Global SRS_NAME
 Should read this from dillorc

 File dpid_common.h
 The dpid error codes will be used in the next patch

 Global main()
 + add new plugins when they become available
 __________________________________________________________

Remove global variables.

Use a singly linked list for dpi_attr_list

Allow dpis to be registered one at a time

Only run dpis listed in users dillorc

MAYBE Have dpid accept all connections to dpis (fixes inf loop if dpi crashes before accept)
