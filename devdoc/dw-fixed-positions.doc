/** \page dw-fixed-positions Fixed positions

In some cases, widgets or widget content must be positioned relative
to the viewport. As in the CSS specification, these positions will be
called "fixed positions". This must not be confused with "fixedly
positioned elements" (see \ref dw-out-of-flow), which are a special
case of fixed positions.


Applications
============

As defined by CSS
-----------------

- "position: fixed"; see  \ref dw-out-of-flow.
- "background-attachment: fixed"; see  \ref dw-images-and-backgrounds.

Idea for tables
---------------

Often, tables have a header, which contains information necessary to
interpret the columns in the table body. For this, HTML defines the elements
&lt;thead&gt; and &lt;tbody&gt;
<sup><a href="#note-table-footer" id="ref-table-footer">[1]</a></sup>.

For large tables, the problem occurs that the table header gets out of
the reader's view. In paged media, where a large table covers multiple
pages, this is often solved by *repeating* the table header on each
page occupied by the table. When using a viewport, a table larger than
the viewport could be displayed like this:

1. If the top of the table is within the viewport, show the table
   header at the usual position.
2. As soon as top of the table gets above the top border of the
   viewport, keep the table header at the viewport top, so that it is
   still visible (this means, it moves down, relative to the
   *canvas*). This way, the header is still visible, so our objective
   is achieved.
3. When scrolling further down, at some point the table body gets out
   of the viewport again, and so should the table header.

(Some images would be nice.)

These ideas should be considered when developing a design for fixed
positions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

<sup><a href="#ref-table-footer" id="note-table-footer">[1]</a></sup>
... and also &lt;tfoot&gt;, which is not discussed here, for reasons
of simplicity. However, it is obvious that &lt;tfoot&gt; should be
dealt with in an analogue way as &lt;thead&gt;.
