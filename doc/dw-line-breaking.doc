<h3>Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines</h3>

Although dillo does not (yet?) implement the algorithm TeX uses for
line breaking, this document shares much of the notation used by the
article <i>Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines</i> by Donald E. Knuth and
Michael F. Plass; originally published in: Software -- Practice and
Experience <b>11</b> (1981), 1119-1184; reprinted in: <i>Digital
Typography</i> by Donalt E. Knuth, CSLI Publications 1999. Anyway an
interesting reading.

<h3>Hyphenation</h3>

Dillo uses the algorithm by Frank Liang, which is described at
http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/. Pattern files can be found at
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyphenation.

<h2>Criteria for Line-Breaking</h2>

Currently, a word (represented by dw::Textblock::Word) has the
following attributes related to line-breaking:

<ul>

<li> the width of the word itself, represented by dw::Textblock::Word::size;
<li> the width of the space following the word, represented by
dw::Textblock::Word::origSpace.
</ul>

[TODO: When is breaking between two words not permitted?]

In a more mathematical notation, the \f$i\f$th word has got a width
\f$w_i\f$ and a space \f$s_i\f$.

With hyphenation, the criteria are refined. Hyphenation should only be
used when otherwise line breaking results in very large spaces. So, we
define:

<ul>
<li>the badness \f$\beta\f$ of a line, which is the greater the more the
spaces between the words differ from the ideal space;
<li>a penalty \f$p\f$ for any possible break point.
</ul>

The goal is to find those break points, where \f$\beta + p\f$ is
minimal.

Examples for the penalty \f$p\f$:

<ul>
<li>0 for normal line breaks (between words);
<li>\f$\infty\f$ to prevent a line break at all costs;
<li>\f$-\infty\f$ to force a line <li>a value > 0 for hyphens.
</ul>

[TODO: which value exactly for hyphens?]

So we need the following values:

<ul>
<li> \f$w_i\f$ (the width of the word \f$i\f$ itself);
<li> \f$s_i\f$ (the width of the space following the word \f$i\f$);
<li> the strechability \f$y_i\f$, a value denoting how much the space
after word\f$i\f$ can be streched (typically \f${1\over 2} s_i\f$);	
<li> the shrinkability \f$y_i\f$, a value denoting how much the space
after word\f$i\f$ can be shrunken (typically \f${1\over 3} s_i\f$);
<li> the penalty \f$p_i\f$, if the line is broken after word \f$i\f$;
<li> a width \f$h_i\f$, which is added, when the line is broken after
word \f$i\f$.
</ul>

\f$h_i\f$ is the width of the hyphen, if the word \f$i\f$ is a part of
the hyphenated word (except the last part); otherwise 0.

Let \f$l\f$ be the (ideal) width (length) of the line. Furthermore,
all words from \f$a\f$ to \f$b\f$ are added to the line. \f$a\f$ is
fixed: we do not modify the previous lines anymore; but our task is to
find a suitable \f$b\f$.

We define:

\f[W_a^b = \sum_{i=a}^{b} w_i + \sum_{i=a}^{b-1} s_i + h_b\f]

\f[Y_a^b = \sum_{i=a}^{b-1} y_i\f]

\f[Z_a^b = \sum_{i=a}^{b-1} z_i\f]


\f$W_a^b\f$ is the total width, \f$Y_a^b\f$ the total strechability, and
\f$Z_a^b\f$ the total shrinkability.

Furthermore the <i>adjustment ratio</i> \f$r_a^b\f$:

<ul>
<li>in the ideal case that \f$W_a^b = l\f$: \f$r_a^b = 0\f$;
<li>if \f$W_a^b < l\f$: \f$r_a^b = (l - W_a^b) / Y_a^b\f$ (\f$r_a^b < 0\f$ in
this case);
<li>if \f$W_a^b > l\f$: \f$r_a^b = (l - W_a^b) / Z_a^b\f$ (\f$r_a^b < 0\f$ in
this case).
</ul>

The badness \f$\beta_a^b\f$ is defined as follows:

<ul>
<li>if \f$r_a^b\f$ is undefined or \f$r_a^b < -1\f$: \f$\beta_a^b = \infty\f$;
<li>otherwise: \f$\beta_a^b = |r_a^b|^3\f$
</ul>

The goal is to find the value of \f$b\f$ where \f$\beta_a^b + p_b\f$
is minimal. (\f$a\f$ is given, since we do not modify the previous
lines.)

After a couple of words, it is not predictable weather this minimum
has already been reached. There are two cases where this is possible
for a given \f$b'\f$:

<ul>
<li>\f$\beta_{b'}^a = \infty\f$ (line gets too tight): \f$a \le b <
b'\f$, the minimun has to be searched between these two values;
<li>\f$p_{b'} = -\infty\f$ (forced line break): \f$a \le b \le b'\f$
(there may be another minimum of \f$\beta_a^b\f$ before; note the
\f$\le\f$ instead of \f$<\f$).
</ul>

This also means, that all lines must be finalized with a forced line
break.

[TODO: Change: only adding complete lines, which leads to "hanging"
words; temporary lines.]

<h2>Soft Hyphens</h2>

Calculating the width causes some problems, since it is not required
that the width of text "AB" is identical to the width of "A" plus the
width of "B". Instead, kerning, ligatures etc. may lead to other
results. For this reason, a word is also always drawn as a whole.

[TODO: Translate the following text to English.]

<pre>
Als Beispiel Wort aus vier trennbaren Silben: A-B-C-D

3 mögliche Trennstelle, daher 8 mögliche Trennungen (allerdings einige
unwahrscheinlich):

ABCD, ABC-D, AB-CD, AB-C-D, A-BCD, A-BC-D, A-B-CD, A-B-C-D,

w sei Wortbreite, l das Ergebnis von textWidth. Zwingende Bedingungen
(bezieht sich auf die Teile, wo kein Trennstrich vorkommt; bei
Trennstrichen kann man eventuell improvisieren):

ABCD                           => w(A) + w(B) + w(C) + w(D) = l(ABCD)
A-BCD                          => w(B) + w(C) + w(D) = l(BCD)
AB-CD, A-B-CD                  => w(C) + w(D) = l(CD)
ABC-D, AB-C-D, A-BC-D, A-B-C-D => w(D) = l(D)

Also einfache Berechnung:

w(D) = l(D)
w(C) = l(CD) - w(D)
w(B) = l(BCD) - (w(C) + w(D))
w(A) = l(ABCD) - (w(B) + w(C) + w(D))

Bei den Breiten inklusive Trennstrich ergibt sich eine
Überbestimmtheit (bei konsanter Trennstrichbreite pro Wort). Daher
wird einfach eine feste Trennstrichbreite angenommen:

w(A-)  = w(A) + l(-)
w(AB-) = w(A) + w(B) + l(-)

usw.

<h2>Bugs and Things Needing Improvement</h2>

<h3>High Priority</h3>

<ul>
<li>There seem to be problems when breaking words containing hyphens
already. Example: "Abtei-Stadt", which is divided into "Abtei-" and
"Stadt", resulting possibly in "Abtei--[new line]Stadt". See also
below under "Low Priority", on how to deal with hyphens and dashes.</li>
<li>Paragraph breaks are depricated and should be replaced by multiple
textblock widgets with (collapsing) margins. See doc/KHM1.html: the
current release of dillo shows a space between the two paragraph, but
dillo_hyphen does not.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medium Priority</h3>

<ul>
<li>Break hyphens and dashes. The following rules seem to be relevant:
<ol>
<li>In English, an em-dash is used with no spaces around. Breaking
before and after the dash should be possible, perhaps with a penalty >
0. (In German, an en-dash (Halbgeviert) with spaces around is used
instead.)</li>
<li>After a hyphen, which is part of a compound word, a break should
be possible. As described above ("Abtei-Stadt"), this collides with
hyphenation.</li>
</ol>
Where to implement? In the same dynamic, lazy way like hyphenation? As
part of hyphenation?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Priority</h3>

<ul>
<li>Should dw::core::Content::BREAK still be used? Currently, this is
    redundant to dw::Textblock::BadnessAndPenalty.</li>
<li>The calculation of badness is designed for justified text. For
    other alignments, it may be modified. (TODO: document this in
    detail.)</li>
<li>It should be simple to assign a larger penalty for hyphens, when
    the line before is already hyphenated. This way, hyphens in
    adjacent are pelalized further.</li>
</ul>
