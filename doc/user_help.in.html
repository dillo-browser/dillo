<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Dillo is a web browser designed to be fast, use few resources and support
slow and unreliable networks on resource-constrained machines. It can load local
and remote files via HTTP, HTTPS and FTP. Other protocols like Gemini, Gopher,
IPFS and others are available as 
<a href="#plugins">plugins</a>.</p>

<p>Dillo supports a subset of HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1 but it <b>doesn't support
JavaScript</b> and only implements some elements of HTML 5 and CSS 3. It also
renders plain text documents and images in PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG and WebP
formats.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>In this section we cover the basics to read a web page, scrolling and finding
or copying text.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>
The graphical interface is designed to be used with a mouse or pointing
device. At the top of the browser window you have the location bar and the main
buttons to control the browser. You can leave the mouse for a brief moment over
any part of the menu to show a tooltip with more information.
<p>
Dillo has <em>context sensitive menus</em>, which are opened with the right mouse
button, available on pages, links, images, forms, the Back and Forward buttons,
and the bug meter. They show different actions to be performed specific to the
element. For example, to save a page you can right-click on the page and select
"Save page as...". Or to copy a link URL you can right-click on a link and
select "Copy link location".
<p>
Dillo can hide all panels and use the whole window area to display the page. To
switch between modes use the ESC key. You can also choose the control panel size
by going to the Tools button and selecting a different one under "Panel size".
<p>
You can open this manual from Dillo by clicking on the top right "?" button. It
doesn't require a network connection.

<h3 id="scrolling">Scrolling</h3>

<p>There are several methods to move or scroll the view of the current page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the <em>keyboard</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Use the <code>Home</code> or <code>End</code> keys to jump to the top
        or to the end of a page.</li>
      <li>Use <code>PgUp</code> or <code>PgDn</code> to advance a whole
        <em>page</em> (window size) minus one <em>step</em>.</li>
      <li>Use the arrow keys to move the view a <em>step</em> in that
        direction.</li>
      <li>You can also use the <code>Space</code> key as <code>PgDn</code> and
        <code>b</code> as PgUp.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using the <em>mouse</em> or <em>pointing device</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Rotate the mouse wheel to move one <em>step</em> in that direction.
          Hold Shift to move one <em>page</em> instead.
      <li>Keep the middle button (or mouse wheel button) pressed while
        dragging to scroll the page precisely.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using the <em>scrollbar</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Drag the thumb in the scrollbar on the side up or down to scroll the
        page.
      <li>Left-click or right-click on the scrollbar above or below the thumb to
        move one <em>page</em> in that direction.
      <li>Middle-click on the scrollbar above or below the thumb to jump to that
        specific position of the page.
      <li>Click the scrollbar arrows to move the view one <em>step</em> in
          that direction.
      <li>Rotate the mouse wheel over the vertical scrollbar to move one
          <em>page</em> in that direction.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can control the <b>size of a <em>step</em></b> by setting the
<code>scroll_step</code> option in the <a href="#dillorc">dillorc</a>
configuration file. By default it will scroll 100 pixels per step. The vertical
scrollbar can be positioned on the left side setting the
<code>scrollbar_on_left</code> option to <code>YES</code>, by default it is on
the right side.</p>

The vertical scrollbar has another mode of operation to navigate full
<em>pages</em> that can be enabled by setting the
<code>scrollbar_page_mode</code> option to <code>YES</code> or temporarily by
holding the Shift key. When this mode is active, left-clicking anywhere on the
scrollbar will scroll down one page and right-clicking will scroll up one page.
Middle clicking on the scrollbar will move the thumb to that position, which can
also be dragged. The Shift key can also be used to temporarily disable this
mode if it was enabled in the configuration.

<h3 id="find-text">Find text</h3>
<p>
To find text in a document right-click to open the <em>Page menu</em> and select
<em>Find text</em> or press <code>Ctrl+F</code> on the keyboard. Then type the
substring that you want to find and click Next (or the <code>Enter</code> key).
</p>
Dillo will scroll the page and highlight found text starting from the top. To
find a word (not a substring) use spaces around it to limit the search to
matching words only. 
<p>
To close the find bar you can click on the red X on the bottom right or press
ESC.

<h3 id="copy-and-paste">Copy and paste</h3>
<p>
To copy some text just hold down the left mouse button and move to select the
area to copy. To paste, go to the target application and press the middle mouse
button.
<p>
If you want to select more than one screen, hold the mouse left button down and
scroll with PgUp, PgDn or the arrow keys.
<P>
If you want to paste an URL into Dillo, do it on the "clear-URL"
button (the "X" next to the <a href="#location-bar">location bar</a>).
<p>

<h3 id="zoom">Zoom</h3>
<p>
You can increase or decrease the size of the elements of a page by changing the
zoom factor. Use <code>Ctrl +</code> to increase the size, <code>Ctrl -</code>
to decrease it and <code>Ctrl 0</code> to reset the value to 100%.
<p>
The initial zoom factor is specified by the <code>zoom_factor</code> option in
the <a href="#dillorc">dillorc</a> configuration file. When a new tab or window
is opened, the current zoom factor value is inherited.

<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
This section focuses on how to navigate to other pages by following hyperlinks,
using bookmarks, typing or pasting a new URL or using the history.

<h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>Hyperlinks (or just links) allow you to navigate to other pages by clicking
them. They change the cursor to a hand to indicate that an element can be
clicked with the left button:
<p style="text-align: center">
<img
  style="border: solid 1px #ddd;"
  alt="hand shaped cursor"
  src="data:image/gif;base64,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">
<p>
Links to other pages usually appear in
<span style="color:blue; text-decoration: underline">blue and underlined</span>
by default and once they are visited they change to 
<span style="color:purple; text-decoration: underline">purple</span>.
However, this is not always the case, so using the mouse cursor shape is the
best indicator of a
<em><a style="color:black; text-decoration: none" href="#">link</a></em>. 
<p>
When you follow a link by clicking on it, the previous pages will be remembered
in case you want to go back to them. Use the Back and Forward buttons on the top
bar to navigate among history pages.
<p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>
When you follow several links across different web pages, they are remembered in
case you can to go back. Use the "Back" and "Forward" buttons of the panel to go
to the previous or next page.
<p>
You can also right-click on the Back or Forward buttons to open a menu with the
list of previous or next pages available, so you can jump directly to them. Use
the left button to open them in the current tab or the middle button to open
them in a new tab.
<p>
The <code>,</code> (comma) and <code>.</code> (dot) keys can be used to jump
backwards or forward (mnemonic: those keys are usually labeled "&lt;" and
"&gt;").

<h3 id="location-bar">Location bar</h3>
<p>
The location bar on the top displays the URL of the current page loaded and can
be used to access other pages by typing the new URL or by pasting it and
pressing Enter.
<p>
The red <b style="color: darkred">x</b>
on the left clears the location bar content when left clicked. Then you can type
or paste a new address from the clipboard by middle clicking on the location
bar.
As these two actions are usually performed together, you can simply middle-click
on the 
<b style="color: darkred">x</b>
button to go to the URL in the clipboard.
<p>
You can also select the location bar content from the keyboard by pressing
<code>Ctrl+L</code>.

<h3 id="web-search">Web search</h3>
<p>
Several search engines are available by pressing the magnifying glass icon next
to the location bar or by pressing <code>Ctrl+S</code>. The search engines are
configured in <a href="#dillorc">Dillorc</a> with the option
<code>search_url</code>. Use it multiple times to define multiple search
engines.
<p>
The location bar can also be used to search the web by using a special prefix
for each search engine. For example, the following line:<br>
<pre>
search_url="dd DuckDuckGo http://duckduckgo.com/lite/?kp=-1&amp;kd=-1&amp;q=%s"
</pre>
<p>
Defines the "DuckDuckGo" search engine with the prefix "<code>dd</code>", so you
can type in the location bar "<code>dd dillo browser</code>" to search with
DuckDuckGo for the keywords "dillo browser".

<h3 id="tabs">Tabs</h3>
<p>
Dillo can open different web pages into tabs. To open a link in a new tab click
the middle button instead of the left button. The same applies to buttons to
submit a form. A new tab can also be opened from the <code>File</code> menu or
using the shortcut <code>Ctrl+T</code>.
<p>
Press <code>Shift</code> while middle-clicking a link to automatically focus the
new tab. If you want this behaviour to be the default, set the following option
in the <a href="#dillorc">dillorc</a> configuration file:
<pre>
focus_new_tab=YES
</pre>
If this option is set, pressing <code>Shift</code> middle-clicking will instead
avoid focusing the new tab.
<p>
It is also possible to have the middle-click open a window instead of a tab. For
this set the option:
<pre>
middle_click_opens_new_tab=NO
</pre>
<p>
To close a tab press the X button on the top right (only visible with multiple
tabs). You can also close the tab by clicking with the right button on the tab
label. The middle button can be used instead by setting the option:
<pre>
right_click_closes_tab=NO
</pre>
<p>
Use the <code>new_tab_page</code> option to control which page is loaded in a
newly opened tab, by default is an empty page. To open the
bookmarks page set the following line in <a href="#dillorc">dillorc</a>:
<pre>
new_tab_page="dpi:/bm/"
</pre>

<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>
Dillo can save URLs of web pages as bookmarks so you can open them later. To
bookmark the current page, open the <em>Page menu</em> by right-clicking on the
page and select "Bookmark this page" (it also works over a link).
<p>
To see or edit the bookmarks, click on the Bookmarks button on the panel or
press <code>Ctrl+B</code>.
<p>
Bookmarks are handled by a built-in Dillo plugin named <code>bm</code> (read more
about plugins in the <a href="#plugins">Plugins section</a>) and are
synchronized across all instances of the browser. The list of bookmarks can also
be shown by opening the URL <a href="dpi:/bm/"><code>dpi:/bm/</code></a>.
<p>
The bookmarks are stored in a simple plain text file named <code>bm.txt</code>
(see the details of this file in the <a href="#bm-txt">bm.txt section</a>). You
can edit the file directly to change the bookmarks.

<h2 id="privacy-and-network">Privacy and network</h2>

<p>The default privacy policy in Dillo attempts to keep the user safe from
tracking, <em>even if this policy breaks a lot of website functionality</em>. In
this section you can add exceptions or relax the configuration at your own risk.

<h3 id="https">HTTPS</h3>

<p>Dillo has support for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>,
allowing secure connections to remote websites. Use the protocol
"<code>https:</code>" to specify the use of HTTPS. When a problem is encountered
with the remote certificate, a warning dialog explains the details and allows
you to choose what to do: continue loading the website or cancel.
<p>
By default Dillo looks for a TLS library at build time, which can be OpenSSL or
mbedTLS. You can see which library is being used by looking at the console when
it starts:
<pre>
$ dillo
dillo_dns_init: Here we go! (threaded)
TLS library: <u>OpenSSL 3.2.1 30 Jan 2024</u>
...
</pre>

<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
<p>
Due to privacy concerns, <b>cookies are disabled by default</b> unless
explicitly enabled in the configuration.
<p>
Support for cookies is implemented using a built-in plugin that shares them
between several instances of Dillo and follows the 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">RFC 6265</a>
specification. Current cookie limits are 20 per domain and
1200 in total.

<p>Cookies are configured by the <code>cookiesrc</code> configuration file. See
the <a href="#cookiesrc">Cookiesrc section</a> to see how to enable cookies for
some domains or accept them by default.</p>

<h3 id="proxy">Proxy</h3>
<p>Dillo can use a HTTP proxy by setting the environment variable
<code>http_proxy</code> or the
<a href="#dillorc">configuration option</a> with the same name. All HTTP and
HTTPS traffic will be sent through the proxy.

<p><b>Note</b>: Plugins may not implement proxy support.
</p>

<h3 id="ad-blocking">Ad blocking</h3>
<p>Dillo has the ability to block content when loading a page based on the domain
the embeded content is being loaded from. You can control how Dillo handles
automatic requests for resources (like images and style sheets) that aren't at
the same domain as the original page.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#domainrc">domainrc</a> configuration file to find out how to
specify which domains are blocked or allowed.</p>

<h3 id="downloads">Downloads</h3>
<p>Downloads are made using 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>
with a <a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a>-based GUI wrapper, through
the <a href="#plugins">Dillo plugin (dpi) framework</a>.
If you close the browser window, downloads will continue.</p>

<h3 id="images-off-mode">Images-off mode</h3>
<p>
You can browse without images now:
<ul>
<li>There is an option in the Tools menu to disable automatic image loading.
An image's alt text (or <code>[IMG]</code> placeholder) will appear in the
page.
<li>If you want to load an individual image, left click on its text.
<li>You can set "no images" as the default mode in dillorc.
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Dillo has <b>several configuration files</b> that control the behavior of the
browser. Each configuration file is searched <em>first</em> in the
<a href="file:~/.dillo"><code>~/.dillo</code></a> directory and,
<em>if not found</em>, in the default system configuration directory (typically
<code>/etc/dillo</code>).</p>

<p>Most configuration files can include comments by <em>starting</em> a line
with the "<code>#</code>" symbol. Their specific syntax is described in the
following sections.</p>

<h3 id="dillorc">Dillorc</h3>

<p>The main configuration of Dillo is controled by the
<a href="file:~/.dillo/dillorc"><code>dillorc</code></a> file.
The list of all available options can be found in the system
configuration file, typically 
<a href="file:/etc/dillo/dillorc"><code>/etc/dillo/dillorc</code></a>. You may
want to copy it into
<a href="file:~/.dillo/dillorc"><code>~/.dillo/dillorc</code></a>
and edit it to suit your needs.</p>

The file is commented to describe what each option does. The default value for
each option as well as other interesting values are also available as comments:
<ul>
  <li>"<code>#option=...</code>" shows the built-in default.</li>
  <li>"<code># option=...</code>" is an additional example.</li>
  <li>"<code>option=...</code>" overrides the built-in value.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>search_url</code> option can be specified multiple times:
<pre>
search_url="dd DuckDuckGo (https) https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?kp=-1&amp;q=%s"
search_url="Wikipedia http://www.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%s&amp;go=Go"
</pre>

<h3 id="cookiesrc">Cookiesrc</h3>

<p>Cookies are configured in the
<a href="file:~/.dillo/cookiesrc"><code>~/.dillo/cookiesrc</code></a>
file by using rules, with one rule per line. The rule syntax is very simple,
first specify the <em>host</em> and then the <em>action</em>, separated by
white spaces. Comment lines start with <code>#</code> as the first character and
the whole line is ignored.
<p>
The host can be in the form <code>example.com</code> to match only that
domain or <code>.example.com</code> to match all subdomains of example.com. The
special word <code>DEFAULT</code> specifies the default policy, when no other
match occurs.
<p>
The action can be: <code>DENY</code> to ignore cookies,
<code>ACCEPT_SESSION</code> to only accept session cookies but don't save them
to disk and <code>ACCEPT</code> to accept and store cookies in disk (this will
allow sites to track you over time).
<p>
When the cookies plugin exits, only the accepted cookies by <code>ACCEPT</code>
are saved to
<a href="file:~/.dillo/cookies.txt"><code>~/.dillo/cookies.txt</code></a>,
and ACCEPT_SESSION cookies are
forgotten. The cookies plugin normally exits after a period of inactivity, but
you can force it to exit with the command <code>dpidc stop</code>.
<p>
Here is an example <code>cookiesrc</code> file:
<pre>
# host        action
DEFAULT       DENY
fltk.org      ACCEPT
.example.com  ACCEPT_SESSION
</pre>
<p> Which is parsed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Line 1: Comment line begins with <code>#</code>.</li>
  <li>Line 2: Deny all cookies from all domains not otherwise specified (this is
    the default).
  <li>Line 3: Accept all cookies from fltk.org, and save them to disk when the
    cookie plugin exits.</li>
  <li>Line 4: Accept all cookies from all subdomains of example.com, but do not
    save them when the cookie plugin exits.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Dillo is especially concerned about privacy and security issues. Our advice is
to <em>avoid cookies whenever possible</em> and at most set ACCEPT_SESSION to
<em>specific trusted sites</em>.

<h3 id="domainrc">Domainrc</h3>

<p>With the
<code>~/.dillo/domainrc</code>
file, you can control how Dillo handles automatic requests for resources
(like images and style sheets) that aren't at the same domain as the
original page.
<p>
The file contains one rule per line. Comments are specified by starting the line
with the <code>#</code> symbol. The default rule is either
<code>default accept</code> or <code>default deny</code> and will cause Dillo
to, respectively, accept all requests by default or deny all requests by
default.
<p>
Depending on the default rule, the next rules behave as exceptions by denying
specific connections or allowing specific connections, respectively.
<p>
Exceptions to the default rule are written in the format
<code>source destination</code>, and match request from the source domain to the
destination domain. The source and destination domains can be specified in three
ways:
<ul>
	<li>"<code>*</code>" to match any domain</li>
	<li>"<code>example.com</code>" to match the specific host example.com</li>
	<li>"<code>.example.com</code>" to match example.com and any of its
		subdomains</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example:
<pre>
# Accept all requests by default
default accept
# But block some ad-sites and trackers from any domain
* .doubleclick.net
* .googleadservices.com
* .quantserve.com
</pre>

<h3 id="style-css">Style.css</h3>

<p>Custom
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS styles</a> can be placed in the 
<a href="file:~/.dillo/style.css"><code>~/.dillo/style.css</code></a>
file to set default web page styles. To override page styles add the
"<code>!important</code>" flag.

<h3 id="dpidrc">Dpidrc</h3>

<p>The configuration for <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> is placed in the 
<a href="file:~/.dillo/dpidrc"><code>~/.dillo/dpidrc</code></a> file.</p>

<p>Plugins are searched in the <code>~/.dillo/dpi/</code> directory first, and
then in the system directory if not found. The <code>dpi_dir</code> option
sets the system <code>dpi</code> directory and must be specified once. Here is
an example:</p>

<pre>
dpi_dir=/usr/lib/dillo/dpi
</pre>

<p>By default, plugins will receive requests at the URL
<code>dpi:/<em>name</em>/</code>, for example bookmarks are available at
<a href="dpi:/bm/"><code>dpi:/bm/</code></a>.

<p>Plugins can also be associated with a protocol (like "<code>file:</code>").
When a request is made using the given protocol the associated plugin is used to
process the request. The rest of the file assigns a plugin to a protocol, one
per line. The syntax is
<code>proto.<em>name</em>=<em>path-to-plugin.dpi</em></code>. The path of the
plugin is relative to the <code>dpi</code> directory. Here are protocols
used by the built-in plugins:</p>

<pre>
proto.file=file/file.dpi
proto.ftp=ftp/ftp.filter.dpi
proto.data=datauri/datauri.filter.dpi
</pre>

<p>Here (

) is an example image using the <code>data:</code> protocol used to define a PNG
image inline in a HTML document.

<h3 id="bm-txt">bm.txt</h3>

<p>Web page URLs can be saved as bookmarks so they can be accessed in the future.
Bookmarks are stored in a plain text file located at
<a href="file:~/.dillo/bm.txt"><code>~/.dillo/bm.txt</code></a>. The file can be
modified by using the
<a href="dpi:/bm/">Book button</a>
in the toolbar and the context menu on a page or link, but they can also be
edited manually. Bookmarks are organized into sections and are given a
description (usually the page title).</p>

<p>The syntax of the <code>bm.txt</code> file is described as follows:</p>

<p>First, the sections are defined at the beginning, prefixed with a
<code>:s<em>N</em>:</code> identifier, along with the description of the
section:</p>
<pre>
:s0: News
:s1: Blog
</pre>
<p>Then every bookmark is added in a single line, by writing the section
identifier, the URL and a description:</p>
<pre>
s0 https://slashdot.org Slashdot
s0 https://news.ycombinator.com/ Hacker News
s1 https://100r.co/site/log.html 100 Rabbits Log
</pre>
<p>The <code>bm.txt</code> file is designed to be <em>easily</em> read by humans
and is suitable to be kept updated among machines by using a version control
tool.

<h3 id="keysrc">Keysrc</h3>

<p>The mapping of keys in Dillo is contolled by the
<a href="file:~/.dillo/keysrc"><code>~/.dillo/keysrc</code></a> file.
The format is "<code>key = action</code>" or
"<code>&lt;modifier&gt;key = action</code>". Lines that begin with a "#" are comments.
The commented-out bindings below show the defaults built into Dillo.

<ul>
<li>Modifiers recognized: Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Meta (on Mac OS X use "Meta" for
Command).

<li>Key names recognized: Backspace, Delete, Down, End, Esc, F1 through
F12, Home, Insert, Left, Menu, PageDown, PageUp, Print, Return, Right, Space,
Tab, Up.

<li>Multimedia keys: Back, Favorites, Forward, HomePage, Mail, MediaNext,
MediaPlay, MediaPrev, MediaStop, Refresh, Search, Sleep, Stop, VolumeDown,
VolumeMute, VolumeUp.
</ul>

<p>If Dillo is running under X11, keys whose names are not recognized can be
specified using their keysym value in hexadecimal. Use <code>xev</code> to get
the keysym, for example:
<pre>
0x1008ff27 = forward
</pre>

<p>The action "nop" (no operation) can be used to remove a binding.

<p>Example file:</p>
<pre>
# "close-all" closes all tabs/windows and exits.
&lt;ctrl&gt;q = close-all

# "left-tab" and "right-tab" switch to the left/right of the current tab.
&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;shift&gt;tab = left-tab

# Use HJKL to move around
k = line-up
j = line-down
h = left
l = right
</pre>

These sections focus on advanced topics and are recommended for experienced
users of Dillo.

<h3 id="plugins">Plugins</h3>
<p>The functionality of Dillo can be extended by using plugins, which can
translate other formats to HTML, implement new protocols or provide a custom
service.</p>

<p>Plugins can be written in <em>any programming language</em> and they 
interact with the browser using the 
<a href="https://dillo-browser.github.io/old/dpi1.html">DPI protocol</a>. A
<a href="https://dillo-browser.github.io/#plugins">list of plugins</a>
is available on the Dillo website. Some plugins are just a 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dillo-browser/dillo-plugin-man/master/man.filter.dpi">few 
lines of shell script</a>, so you are encouraged to read them to learn how to
write your own plugins. Plugins are searched by looking for files that end with
the <code>.dpi</code> extension (or <code>.dpi.exe</code> in Windows) in
<code>~/.dillo/dpi</code> and <code>dpi_dir</code> (see the
<a href="#dpidrc">Dpidrc</a> configuration section).</p>

<p>There are two types of plugins: <em>filters</em> and <em>servers</em>.
Filters are executed for each request like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">UNIX pipe</a>,
they read from the
standard input and write to the standard output. The name of filter plugin
programs must end in <code>.filter.dpi</code>. On the other hand, servers listen
on a socket for new requests. They can process several requests at the same
time, preventing the overhead of spawning multiple processes and they can easily
share information among requests.</p>

<p>You can install plugins from any third party, but you should always
review the source before running code written by others. To install a new
plugin, copy the files to <code>~/.dillo/dpi/<em>name</em>/</code> and
then associate the <em>name</em> protocol to the program that must run in
the
<a href="file:~/.dillo/dpidrc"><code>~/.dillo/dpidrc</code></a> file.
Plugins may have other software dependencies required for it to work.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to manually install the
<a href="https://github.com/dillo-browser/dillo-plugin-gemini">Gemini protocol plugin</a>
(it comes with a Makefile that automates the process, so this is not necessary),
which is a filter plugin written in shell script:</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.dillo/dpi/gemini
$ cp gemini.filter.dpi ~/.dillo/dpi/gemini/
$ chmod +x ~/.dillo/dpi/gemini/gemini.filter.dpi
$ echo "proto.gemini=gemini/gemini.filter.dpi" >> ~/.dillo/dpidrc
$ dpidc stop
</pre>
<p>Now, when a request is made to an URL that begins with the
<code>gemini:</code> protocol, it will be processed by the
<code>gemini/gemini.filter.dpi</code> program, and the output will be displayed
by Dillo.</p>

<h3 id="bug-meter">Bug Meter</h3>
<p>
Dillo includes a
<a 	href='https://dillo-browser.github.io/old/help/bug_meter.html'>bug meter</a>
which shows the number of detected bugs inside the page. The bugs are caught at
parsing time, so the error messages also show the line where they occur and
provide a hint of what was expected instead.
<p>
The primary purpose of the bug meter is to help webmasters and page authors to
polish the contents of their sites with a view to making them
compliant with HTML standards.
<p>
The bug meter is located at the lower right corner of Dillo. Use the left-click
to see the messages, right-click for a menu to open other HTML validators.

<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<p>
Most actions can be issued by using a keyboard shortcut. The key bindings can be
changed in the
<code><a href="file:~/.dillo/keysrc">~/.dillo/keysrc</a></code> file (see the
<a href="#keysrc">keysrc</a> section).
The list of default bindings is given in the following table.
<p>
