Should be incorporated into dw::Textblock.</div>

This texts deals with both floats and absolute positions, which have
in common, that there is a distinction between generating block and
containing block (we are here using the same notation as in the
CSS&nbsp;2 specification). Consider this snippet (regarding floats):


    <ul>
      <li>Some text.</li>
      <li>
	<div style="float:right; width=50%">Some longer text, so
	  that the effect described in this passage can be
	  demonstrated.
	</div>
	Some more and longer text.</li>
      <li>Final text.</li>
    </ul>

which may be rendered like this

     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .
    |   * Some text.                                    
	* Some more and      -  - - - - - - - - - - -.|
    |     longer text.      |Some longer text, so that  
	* Final text.        the effect described     ||
    ` - - - - - - - - - - - |above in this passage can '
			     be demonstrated.         |
			    ` - - - - - - - - - - -  -  

The float (the DIV section) is defined ("generated") within the list
item, so, in CSS 2 terms, the list item is the generating block of the
float. However, as the image shows, the float is not contained by the
list item, but another block, several levels above (not shown
here). In terms of ::dw, this means that the dw::Textblock
representing the float cannot be a child of the dw::Textblock
representing the generating block, the list item, since the allocation
of a child widget must be within the allocation of the parent
widget. Instead, to each dw::Textblock, another dw::Textblock is
assigned as the containing box.

Definition of "containing block"
================================

The following definition follows the definition in the CSS 2
specification. For a given dw::Textblock, the containing block is
defined as the one dw::Textblock following these rules:

- For the toplevel widget, the containing block is itself.
- Otherwise, the next dw::Textblock up in the tree (which may also
  this widget) is searched, which is out of flow (float or absolutely
  positioned) or a table cell.

TODO: 

1. Compare this to
   <http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#containing-block-details>.
2. Handle fixed positions: in this case, the viewport is the
   containing box, but the viewport is not represented by a widget.
3. Clarify: the element out of flow must not be a dw::Textblock.


Implementation overview
=======================

Both dw::Textblock::notifySetAsTopLevel and
dw::Textblock::notifySetParent set the member
dw::Textblock::containingBlock appropriately, according to the rules
defined above.

Handling widgets out of flow is partly the task of the new class
dw::OutOfFlowMgr, which is managed by dw::Textblock::outOfFlowMgr, but
only for containing blocks. Generating blocks should refer to
_containingBlock->outOfFlowMgr_.

dw::Textblock::addWidget is extended, so that floats and absolutely
positioned elements can be added. Notice that not this widget, but the
containing block becomes the parent of the newly added child, if it is
out of flow. dw::Textblock::addWidget decides this by calling
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::isOutOfFlow.

There are still relations between the element out of flow and the
generating box; details are described below.

(Some notes about what has do be done for fixed elements: (i) In the
current design, there is only one containing block for a given
generating block. However, a given generating block may contain an
element with absolute position (or, a float), 

As already mentioned, the containing box


Relation between generating box and containing box
==================================================

<div style="border: 2px solid #ff0000; margin-bottom: 0.5em;
padding: 0.5em 1em; background-color: #ffefe0"><b>Warning:</b>

TODO: new implementation of dw::core::Widget::parentRef.

Changing the size of an element out of flow
-------------------------------------------
The element out of flow will call dw::Widget::queueResize, which will
result in a call of dw::Widget::markSizeChange for the containing
block. The containing block will notice (by dw::Widget::parentRef)
that the size change is originated in an element out of flow, and so
delegate it to dw::OutOfFlowManager::markSizeChange.

dw::OutOfFlowManager	::markSizeChange calls dw::Widget::queueResize for
the _generating_ block, with the line, where this float has been
generated, as an argument, so that the generating block will rewrap
down from this line. It is important here that an infinite loop is
prevented here (see next section).

Eventually, dw::Widget::sizeRequest is called again.

(TODO: This is only relevant for floats, not for elements with
absolute position. Only dw::OutOfFlowManager should have to care about
this.)

Rewrapping a line with a float reference
----------------------------------------

Sketch: in dw::Textblock::rewrap, before the actual rewrapping, all
elements out of flow must be set as "non-located" (this means for
floats, that they are -- temporally -- not visible, and so do not have
an impact on the borders). The actual rewrapping will tell the
vertical position (and more? actually only plays a role for floats) of
elements out of flow to dw::OutOfFlowManager.

for dw::Widget. Perhaps a glossary?

TODO: DeepIterator may need the generating parent widget in some cases.
