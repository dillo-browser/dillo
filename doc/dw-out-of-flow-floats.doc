/** \page dw-out-of-flow-floats Handling Elements Out Of Flow: Floats

(Note: Bases on work at <http://flpsed.org/hgweb/dillo_grows>, I plan
to split the documentation on elements out of flow into different
parts: general part, floats, positioned elements. In this document,
informations about floats are collected.)


GB lists and CB lists
=====================

Floats generated by a block which is not yet allocated are initially
put into a list related to the *generator*:

- dw::OutOfFlowMgr::TBInfo::leftFloatsGB or
- dw::OutOfFlowMgr::TBInfo::rightFloatsGB.

These lists are also called GB lists.

Floats of allocated generators are put into lists related to the
*container* (called CB lists):

- dw::OutOfFlowMgr::leftFloatsCB or
- dw::OutOfFlowMgr::rightFloatsCB.

As soon as the container is allocated, all floats are moved from the
GB lists to the CB lists (dw::OutOfFlowMgr::sizeAllocateStart →
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::moveFromGBToCB).

Here, it is important to preserve the *generation order* (for reasons,
see below: *Sorting floats*), i. e. the order in which floats have
been added (dw::OutOfFlowMgr::addWidgetOOF).  This may become a bit
more complicated in a case like this:

    <head>
      <style>
	#fl-1, #fl-2, #fl-3 { float: right }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="bl-1">
	<div id="fl-1">float 1</div>
	<div id="bl-2">
	  <div id="fl-2">float 2</div>
	</div>
	<div id="fl-3">float 3</div>
      </div>
    </body>

The floats are generated in this order:

- #fl-1 (generated by #bl-1),
- #fl-2 (generated by #bl-2),
- #fl-3 (generated by #bl-1).

Since the floats must be moved into the CB list in this order, it
becomes clear that the floats from one GB list cannot be moved at
once. For this reason, each float is assigned a "mark", which is
different from the last one as soon as the generator is *before* the
generator of the float added before. In the example above, there are
three generators: body, #bl-1, and #bl-2 (in this order), and floats
are assigned these marks:

- #fl-1: 0,
- #fl-2: also 0,
- #fl-3 is assigned 1, since its generator (#bl-1) lies before the
   last generator (#bl-2).

dw::OutOfFlowMgr::moveFromGBToCB will then iterate over all marks, so
that the generation order is preserved.


Sorting floats
==============

Floats are sorted, to make binary search possible, in these lists:

- for each generator: dw::OutOfFlowMgr::TBInfo::leftFloatsGB and
  dw::OutOfFlowMgr::TBInfo::rightFloatsGB;
- for the container: dw::OutOfFlowMgr::leftFloatsCB and
  dw::OutOfFlowMgr::rightFloatsCB.

The other two lists, dw::OutOfFlowMgr::leftFloatsAll and
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::rightFloatsAll are not sorted at all.

New floats are always added to the end of either list; this order is
called *generation order*. See also above: *GB lists and CB lists*.

On the other hand, there are different sorting criteria, implemented
by different comparators, so that different kinds of keys may be used
for searching. These sorting criteria are equivalent to the generation
order.

dw::OutOfFlowMgr::Float::CompareSideSpanningIndex compares
*sideSpanningIndex* (used to compare floats to those on the respective
other side); if you look at the definition
(dw::OutOfFlowMgr::addWidgetOOF) it becomes clear that this order is
equivalent to the generation order.

dw::OutOfFlowMgr::Float::CompareGBAndExtIndex compares *externalIndex*
for floats with same generators, otherwise: (i) if one generator (T1)
is a direct anchestor of the other generator (T2), the child of T1,
which is an anchestor of, or identical to, T2 is compared to the float
generated by T1, using *externalIndex*, as in this example:

    T1 -+-> child --> ... -> T2 -> Float
        `-> Float

Otherwise, the two blocks are compared, according to their position in
dw::OutOfFlowMgr::tbInfos:

    common anchestor -+-> ... --> T1 -> Float
                      `-> ... --> T2 -> Float

This is equivalent to the generation order, as long it is ensured that
*externalIndex* reflects the generation order within a generating
block, for both floats and child blocks.
