 Dillo
=======

  Release 2.2 is part of of the dillo-2.x generation of the
Dillo  web  browser.  In this new series significant parts of the
codebase  were  ported  to C++, and the rendering engine now uses
the FLTK2 library instead of GTK1.

  This release features a major overhaul of the cookies subsystem,
a reimplementation of the DPI API, a configurable connection limit,
and various CSS improvements.

  Here's a list of some well known problems:

         * no FRAMES rendering
         * no https (there's a barebones prototype).

-----
FLTK2
-----

  The FLTK2 library is statically linked into Dillo2.
  You can get it from fltk.org.
The recommended version is >= r6916. e.g. in:

  http://fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=2.0.x-r6916


------------
Dpi programs
------------

  These  are  installed by "make install". If you don't have root
access,  copy  "dillo"  and "dpid" to some directory in your path
and  install  the  dpis by running "./install-dpi-local" from the
top directory (they will be installed under ~/.dillo).


----
*BSD
----

  Dillo   compiles on *BSD systems; please report on this anyway,
and note that you'll need GNU make.

  If your dillo crashes or locks at times, just use:

    ./configure --disable-threaded-dns

  so dillo uses a single thread for name resolving.


-------
Solaris
-------

  Dillo may compile and run OK on Solaris but (please report):

    * use gmake (a symbolic link make -> gmake works OK)

  Solaris is very inconsistent so you may need to add/remove:

  -lrt -lposix4

  at link time.
