 Dillo
=======

  Release 2.1.1 is part of of the dillo-2.x generation of the
Dillo  web  browser.  In this new series significant parts of the
codebase  were  ported  to C++, and the rendering engine now uses
the FLTK2 library instead of GTK1.

dillo-2.1.1:

  This release improves image size checking.

dillo-2.1:

  This  release  came with substantial improvements, among which
the  most important is a basic CSS infrastructure! There are also
configurable  keybindings  among  other  goodies. Please read the
Changelog highlights in the splash page of the browser itself.

dillo-2.0 brought:

  The same things dillo1 had, plus tabbed browsing, antialiasing,
different  character  sets,  accepting  compressed pages, control
over image loading, smaller footprint, fewer dependencies, better
table  rendering,  bugfixes, improved GUI, ... In brief, a better
dillo.


  Here's a list of some well known problems:

         * no FRAMES rendering
         * no https (there's a barebones prototype).

-----
FLTK2
-----

  The FLTK2 library is statically linked into Dillo2.
  You can get it from fltk.org.
The recommended version is >= r6916. e.g. in:

  http://fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=2.0.x-r6916


------------
Dpi programs
------------

  These  are  installed by "make install". If you don't have root
access,  copy  "dillo"  and "dpid" to some directory in your path
and  install  the  dpis by running "./install-dpi-local" from the
top directory (they will be installed under ~/.dillo).


----
*BSD
----

  Dillo   compiles on *BSD systems; please report on this anyway,
and note that you'll need GNU make.

  If your dillo crashes or locks at times, just use:

    ./configure --disable-threaded-dns

  so dillo uses a single thread for name resolving.


-------
Solaris
-------

  Dillo may compile and run OK on Solaris but (please report):

    * use gmake (a symbolic link make -> gmake works OK)

  Solaris is very inconsistent so you may need to add/remove:

  -lrt -lposix4

  at link time.
